## Introduction
Azure, like Google and Amazon Cloud Platforms, is Microsoft's Cloud Platform. It is typically a platform that allows us to use Microsoft tools. It offers us virtual machines, fast data processing, analytical tools, and monitoring instruments to simplify our work. Azure pricing is also simpler and cheaper. It is commonly referred to as "Pay as You Go", meaning you only pay for the services when you are using them.

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing is basically storing data and accessing the computers over the internet. It is the delivery of different computing services like servers, software, analytics, databases, and storage via the internet.
Benefits of Cloud Computing
We all know that Cloud Computing has brought a major change in the traditional business thinking for IT resources. There are many benefits of using Cloud Computing. Some of which are:
- Cost
- Scalability
- Increase Speed and Agility
- Reliability
- Security
The Economy of Cloud Computing
In the traditional environment of organizations, as there is a need for large
investments on CapEx, Cloud is the best wayto switch to the pay-as-you-go
model. Mostly in Azure, the pricing is based on an hourly basis like VMs,
App Services, etc. There is also consumption based pricing which is on the
basis of per execution of function, per second use of resource, or both. An
example of consumption based pricing is Azure Function.
Technical Terms
In order to understand Cloud Computing, you need to understand some
technical terms.
High Availability (HA) - you get high availability for your servers
by replacing instantly the failed server with the new one. HA
depends on the number of VMs that you set up to eventually cover
in case one goes down
Fault Tolerance - Fault tolerance means that if there is any fault
from the Azure side, then it is immediately mitigated by Azure
itself with zero down time
Disaster Recovery (DR) - In case of any catastrophic disaster like
cyber-attack, there is a plan in DR to recover your business from
these critical systems or in normal operation if such an event
occurs
Scalability - In cloud computing, scalability means addition or
removal of the resources in an easy and quick way as per demand
Elasticity - Elasticity is the capacity to dynamically extend or
minimize network resources to respond to autonomous working
load adjustments and optimize the use of resources
Agility - Agility is the capability to adapt quickly and efficiently to
changes in the business environment. Agility also refers to the
ability to quickly develop, test and deploy business-led software
applications
Types of Cloud Computing
IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service)
PAAS (Platform as a Service)
Serverless
SAAS (Software as a Service)
Cloud Computing Deployments Models
There are three different types of Cloud Computing: Public, Private and
Hybrid.
Public cloud is owned and operated by third parties that are
providing computing services like storage, software etc.
A private cloud is a model that uses the same legacy IT
infrastructure running cloud resources within its own data center
Hybrid Clouds integrate public and private clouds together with the
technology to share data and applications. The hybrid cloud
provides greater versatility and allows further deployment
What is Azure?
Microsoft Azure is known as Windows Azure and it is a Public Cloud. It is
free to build, manage and deploy applications with your favorite tools and
frames in a huge, global network. Azure is considered for offering both IaaS
and PaaS. Azure offers over 100 services, from the execution of existing
applications on virtual machines to exploration of new tech paradigms like
smart bots and mixed reality.
In order to use Azure, you first need to setup an Azure account directly by
going to “Azure.com” or with the help of a representative. You can sign-up to
Azure as a Free account with free USD 200 credit and 25+ free services.
Azure Market Place
The Azure market place offers technical solutions and services from
Microsoft and partners to build and extend Azure products and services. It
has all kinds of services and applications like VMs, templates, apps, and
Azure managed services etc.
Global Footprint
Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider — which offers
the scale required to bring users around the world closer to applications.
There are 58 regions of Azure that are available around the world with 140
available in 140 countries.
Regions
Regions are geographical areas where Azure is present to deploy the Azure
resources. It is a set of data centers with latency-defined perimeter connected
via a dedicated regional low-latency network.
How to Choose a Region?
When you are choosing a region, you need to think about three things mainly:
Location
Features
Price
Geographies/Paired Regions
Geography is a distinct market that usually conserves data residence and
compliance boundaries with two or more regions within the same geographic
area.
Availability Set
An Availability Set is a logical grouping function that can be used to separate
VM resources from each other.
Availability Zone
Availability Zones (AZ) are locations within an Azure region that are
physically separate. An availability zone is composed of one or more
independently operating power, and network data centers. Each region has a
minimum of three zones.
Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
It is an underlying service where the Azure resource deployment and
management is done. It provides a management layer, which lets you create,
upgrade, and uninstall your Azure subscription tools.
ARM Benefits
You have group resource handlings
You get consistency
You can define the dependencies between resources in the right
order
Access Control, which is built-in to assign access to the users
Tagging
For billing, you can use tagging to stay on top
Azure Services
There is a number of available services and features in Azure. The most
commonly used categories are:
Compute
Networking
Storage
Mobile
Databases
Web
Internet of Things
Big Data
Artificial Intelligence
Security and Identity
Monitoring and Management
Compute
In Azure, there is a number of options that are available for application and
service hosting. Azure Compute provides you an infrastructure where you
can run your applications.
Networking
The key function of Azure networking is the relation of compute resources
and access to applications. There are various networking services in Azure
that can be used individually or together. Azure networking provides you the
most secure environment for your data as compared to any other Cloud
Platform.
Storage
Azure Storage is a cloud storage system from Microsoft that helps to store
up-to-date files. Azure Storage offers an extremely scalable data object store,
a cloud file system service, a reliable message store, and a NoSQL store.
Azure Storage is secure, highly available and durable, scalable, managed and
accessible.
Data and Analytics
Data is available in all sizes and formats. When they speak about Big Data, it
means they refer to large volumes of information. It often is so large that it is
no longer appropriate for traditional methods of processing and analysis.
To cope with these large data sets, Open Source cluster technologies have
been developed. Microsoft Azure offers a wide range of Big Data and
analytics tools and services.
Databases
Azure Database is a fully managed service. It has business-grade efficiency
with integrated high availability that ensures you can easily scale and hit
global distribution without needing to pay attention to costly downtime.
Web and Mobile
Great web experience in today's business is important. Azure provides
premium support for the creation and management of web applications and
HTTP-based web services. Azure builds engaging cross platforms for
Android, iOS and Windows applications without any compromises that suit
your business needs and reach to your customers everywhere.
Security and Identity
We know that safety is one thing in the cloud and it is very important to have
accurate and timely Azure Security information. Azure has a wide range of
security tools and features that make it the best reason to use for your
applications and services. You can protect Azure identity and access
management solutions for your applications and data on the front door.
Monitoring and Management
Azure management and governance tools help system managers and
developers to secure and compliant the resources, both in-house and on the
cloud. It monitors the infrastructure, software, system provision and set-up,
app-updating, vulnerability detection, backup resources, disaster recovery,
policy implementation, process automation, and even the management of
costs— during the IT cycle.
